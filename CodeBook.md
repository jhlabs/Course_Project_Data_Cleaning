The output variables are essentially taken from the original dataset. 
However, a couple of changes were made to make them clean:

* No brackets, dashes or empty spaces
* Only small captions

I did not write out the abreviations, such as time for "t". I found the variables
however fairly descriptive. Also there is a tradeoff between length of the measurement
name and understanding.

The final data set contains four columns:

* activity - the performed activity when the measurement was taken
* subject - the person who performed the activity coded by an integer
* measurement - the type of measurement that was taken
* mean - the mean of the measurement taken
